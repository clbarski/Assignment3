My code for assignment 3 compiles and runs as intended. It works as its supposed to, and I tested for different examples. I initially tried writing the code using 
an array, but found that using the List was a lot easier. The biggest challenge of this assignment was understanding the directions. It took many times reading
over and asking questions to figure out what the assignment actually was. After that, the assignment wasnt too hard.
